Hi, I’m Vadim Vaganov from Moscow, Russia.
I’m interested mostly in Java and Kotlin development at the moment but often play with new languages and technologies, previously worked with C#.
I’m currently trying to deepen my knowledge in Java, Kotlin, JVM, functional programming, software architecture, testing, databases etc.
You can reach me by email at vrvaganov@gmail.com or by twitter at @vrvaganov.
