Hi, I’m Vadim Vaganov from Moscow, Russia.
I’m interested mostly in .NET development at the moment but often play with new languages and technologies.
I’m currently learning functional programming and F#, trying to deepen my knowledge in C#, .NET, software architecture, testing, databases etc.
You can reach me by email at vrvaganov@gmail.com or by twitter at @vrvaganov.
